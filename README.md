# BWEM-community

Brood War Easy Map is a C++ library that analyses Brood War's maps and provides relevant information such as areas, choke points and bases. It is built on top of the BWAPI library (http://bwapi.github.io/index.html). It first aims at simplifying the development of bots for Brood War, but can be used for any task requiring high level map information.

BWEM-community is based on BWEM by Igor Dimitrijevic. It is a community maintained version of BWEM, containing fixes and changes by the community. Orginal BWEM can be found [here](http://bwem.sourceforge.net/).
